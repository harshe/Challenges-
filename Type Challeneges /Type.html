              <p> The Helvetica® font family was developed and continuously refined by the Haas’sche Schriftgiesserei AG and then D. Stempel AG. The key design concepts were drawn by Max Miedinger in 1957.
Apple and Adobe later obtained the licenses from Linotype for the Neue Helvetica® font, which is still one of the most popular typefaces worldwide.
The font Helvetica® (Latin for Swiss) has the objective and functional style which was associated with Swiss typography in the 1950s and 1960s.
The font is perfect for international correspondence: no ornament, no emotion, just clear presentation of information. Helvetica font is still one of most popular sans-serif fonts.
Helvetica font, the typeface par excellence, can look back on a colorful life. Originally designed for hand composition, it has been adapted over the years for all methods of composition: from hot metal line composition,
and opto-mechanical phototypesetting of the first generation, to digital typesetters.

Influences of Helvetica included Schelter-Grotesk and Haas' Normal-Grotesk. Attracting considerable attention on its release as Neue Haas Grotesk, Linotype adopted Neue Haas Grotesk for widespread release.
In 1960, its name was changed by Haas' German parent company Stempel to Helvetica (meaning Swiss in Latin) in order to make it more marketable internationally.
It comes from the Latin name for the pre-Roman tribes of what became Switzerland. Intending to match the success of Univers, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned Neue Haas Grotesk into a larger family.
The design was popular, and rapidly made available for phototypesetting systems as well as for the original metal type. Many imitations and knock-offs were rapidly created.
In the late 1970s and 1980s, Linotype licensed its version to Xerox and then Adobe and Apple, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the PostScript page description language.
The rights to it are now held by Monotype Imaging, which acquired Linotype; the advanced Neue Haas Grotesk release (discussed below) was co-released with Font Bureau. </p>

 <div class="Characteristics">
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tall x-height, which makes it easier to read in smaller sizes and at distance</li>
<li>Quite tight spacing between letters</li>
<li>An oblique rather than italic style, a common feature of almost all grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces</li>
<li>Narrow t and f</li>
<li>Square-looking s</li>
<li>Bracketed top flag of 1</li>
<li>Rounded off square tail of R</li>
<li>Concave curved stem of 7</li>
<li>Two-storied a (with curves of bowl and of stem), a standard neo-grotesque feature</li>
</ul>

<p>Like many neo-grotesque designs, Helvetica has narrow apertures, which limit its legibility onscreen and at small print sizes.
  It also has no visible difference between upper-case 'i' and lower-case 'L', although the number 1 is quite identifiable with its flag at top left.
  Its tight, display-oriented spacing may also pose problems for legibility. In situations where this matters, other designs intended for legibility at small sizes above all, such as Verdana,
  Meta or Trebuchet or a monospace font such as Courier, which makes all letters quite wide, may be more appropriate </p>
